Teaches how to live a Sustainable Lifestyle!!
The file is too big for github lmao, here's the link https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DS1JRXbTcrKZn3KbxPCJUp_HoObsM8HX/view?usp=sharing

There're three minigame-like jobs where you can earn money from, 
read how to play each game from the how to play menu that you can click when first starting every minigame/

Collect money and spend it however you like, buy clothes, houses, upgrades, etc etc.

Every 15 days there will be an electric bill that you must pay, 
the amount you have to pay is based on which house you're using and whether you have a solar panel and/or wind turbine

Every now and then there will be a random event that tests your knowledge and decision making skill.
Pick right and you will be rewarded, pick wrong and you'll get a penalty.

Be carefull, you can fall into debt!!

Always exit with the save and quit button on the main setting button, click the setting button again to close the settings.


Happy playing!
